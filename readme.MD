## Micro Django
A journey through building a django-graphql based micro service.
The repo also explores using [ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/) to build a federated schema.
This is part of a micro service architecture where this handles the doctors service. Other services in this project are the `Patients` and `diagnosis` services.
## Tech stack
1. Django for backend and business logic
2. [Ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/) to resolve python/django objects to graphql API
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
 [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for container management and deployment.
 
## Overall Architecture.
**Micro-django** is modelled as a doctors service app. The whole architecture involves 3 micro services
1. [Doctors service](https://github.com/KimaruThagna/micro-django)
2. [Patient's service](https://github.com/KimaruThagna/patient-microservice)
3. [Diagnosis service](https://github.com/KimaruThagna/diagnosis-microservice)

and a final service running [apollo federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/) that allows a client to access all 3 services
via a single data graph by implementing a [gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/gateway/).
The gateway service repo can be found [here](https://github.com/KimaruThagna/hospital-federated)

## Installation and running
A pre requisite to install and run this service is 
having [docker]() and [docker compose]() installed
Once installed, clone this repo into your local machine and navigate to the
position of the `docker-compose.yml` file
To spin up the service, run the command
```apex
docker-compose up
```
To access the service via the broswer, log on to [http://0.0.0.0:8000/]()
